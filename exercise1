Docker Exercise: Multi-Container Web Application
Task: Create a simple web application with a Python Flask backend and Redis cache, running in separate containers.
Requirements:

Create a Flask application that:

Has an endpoint that counts page visits
Stores the visit count in Redis
Returns "Hello! This page has been visited X times"


Set up two containers:

One for the Flask app
One for Redis


Create the necessary files:

app.py - Your Flask application
requirements.txt - Python dependencies
Dockerfile - To containerize the Flask app
docker-compose.yml - To orchestrate both containers


Goals:

Containers should communicate with each other
The app should be accessible on http://localhost:5000
Visit count should persist as long as containers are running



Bonus Challenges:

Add volume mapping so Redis data persists even after container restart
Add environment variables for configuration
Implement health checks

I've created a complete Docker multi-container application for you. Here's what's included:
📦 Solution Overview
5 files that work together to create a Flask + Redis application:

app.py - Flask web app that counts page visits using Redis
requirements.txt - Python dependencies (Flask & Redis client)
Dockerfile - Instructions to containerize the Flask app
docker-compose.yml - Orchestrates both Flask and Redis containers
README.md - Complete documentation and usage instructions

🚀 Quick Start
Just run these commands in the directory with these files:
bashdocker-compose up --build
Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser!
🎯 Key Features Implemented

✅ Two containers communicating over a Docker network
✅ Persistent Redis data with volumes
✅ Environment variables for configuration
✅ Health checks for both services
✅ Proper dependency management (Flask waits for Redis)
